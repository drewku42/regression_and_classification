# regression_and_classification

The code found in this repository are the python implementations of cost functions and gradient descent algorithms for linear and logistic regression models. I learned the foundation of this code through 
the Machine Learning Specialization offered through Coursera by Andrew Ng. Building these functions from scratch has reinforced my understanding of supervised learning algorithms.
